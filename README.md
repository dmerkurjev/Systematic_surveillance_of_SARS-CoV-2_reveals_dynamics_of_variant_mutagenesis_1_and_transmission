 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq â€” Preprocessing & Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for RNA-seq analysis of early passage and senescent BJ fibroblasts in the absence or continued presence of doxycycline (20nm).
It includes two main components:

Preprocessing (Clean.sh)
Downloads SRA runs, builds 4 sample FASTQs, performs QC, alignment, and outputs gene transcription level.

Analysis (Differential_expression.sh)
Performs differential expression analysis using edgeR.

Directory Output

The preprocessing script creates a structured working directory data_pre_processing/ containing:

raw/      # downloaded and processed SRA FASTQs  
fastq/    # concatenated FASTQs (one per sample)  
aligned/  # hisat-aligned BAMs  
counts/   # gene-level count matrix   
qc/       # FastQC output  
bowtie2_index/  # reference index for alignment  


You can skip raw FASTQ processing and go straight to analysis using data_RNAcounts/final_counts_symbols.tsv.
